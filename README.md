First of all,i installed the latest git version from the website->"https://git-scm.com/downloads" and then downloaded the version 2.29.2. 
It got installed in my system extracting the neccessary files. Then i created an account in github following the website github.com and then created a remote repository for web programming.
After the installation of git i initialized the git using command "git init" and it was initialized in one of my local drives named ".git".
Then i configured git by using "git config" command providing the username and email.
After that I then created another folder inside the same drive to store the initialized git folder and copied the html folders which i used to push it to the remote repository.
After configuring, i created a commit using the command ->git commit -m "name ",then i used the command "git remote add origin "to add the link of the remote repository.
and then pushed the files from local repository to the remote repository with the command->"git push -u origin master and with that, my files got uploaded in the remote repository.
Hence,verified the same in the remote repository and after that i created another file in the remote repository to pull it into the local repository using the command
->"git pull origin master" and verified that the file created on remote repository has appeared inside the local repository.
I have created two html files one formed was about my personal details containing contact details and graduation marks details which was a single html page and gave a link of these two
pages separately. Tags for creating tables,lists,navigation etc were used and the reference used for this is from website "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/".
Another web page i created was of the map of india in which 4 states were made clickable connecting it to their wikipedia page through mapping using tags such as map,area,shape,coords etc were
used.
